# Basic Analysis with Taguette

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

This activity focuses on analyzing and exporting your coded data in Taguette. You will learn how to review your coding results, explore passages associated with specific tags (also known as codes), and export your coded material into formats that can be used for further analysis and writing. These tools help you move from initial coding to organizing and synthesizing your findings.

1. One of the simplest ways to begin analyzing your data is to click on the **Highlights** tab and review the counts for each of the tags you created.

2. Click the “**See all highlights**” to view a summary of all the passages you have coded.

3. To view passages for a specific tag, click on that tag in the list on the left. Only the passages associated with that tag will be displayed on the right.
Tip: If you are using sub-tags, clicking on a main tag will display passages for both the main tag and all of its sub-tags.

4. **Exporting Your Passages to Support Writing and Analysis.** You can export all of your coded passages to your computer to help with reviewing, synthesizing, and writing up your research.
  - Click on the **Highlights** tab.
  - Click “**See all highlights**.”
  - On the right side of the screen, click the “**Export this view**” button
  - Choose the export format you prefer (for example, **DOCX**).

5. **Exporting Passages for an Individual Tag**. This process is similar to exporting all passages, but you begin by selecting a specific tag.
  - Click on the **Highlights** tab.
  - Select a tag you would like to export from the list on the left.
  - On the right side of the screen, click **“Export this view.”**
  - Choose the export format you prefer (for example, **DOCX**).

6. **Great job!** You have now exported your coded passages in a format that you can use to further analyze and synthesize for your research project.

7. **OPTIONAL**. If you would like to analyze your codes further in Excel:
  - •	Click on the **Project Info** tab in Taguette.
  - Select the **Export Codebook** dropdown button.
  - Choose the **Excel** option.
  - An Excel file containing all of your tags will be downloaded to your computer for further analysis.
