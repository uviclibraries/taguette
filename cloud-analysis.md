# Visualization with Word Clouds

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

In addition, if you think you would find it helpful, here is a [step-by-step video tutorial for this activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4P-VNo7ozU){:target="_blank"} as a suplement to the steps below.

1. Create a free account at the [**Word Art**](https://wordart.com/){:target="_blank"} website. 

   **Note:** If you have just completed “**Activity 4 – Excel Activities**” in this workshop, you can skip Steps 2-4 and proceed directly to Step 5.

2. **Log in to Taguette** and open your project so you can see your uploaded documents.

3. Select the **Highlights** tab, then click “**See all highlights**” to view a summary of all the passages you have coded.

4. **Exporting your Passages in Preparation for Writing Up Your Research**: Exporting all your Passages with their Codes - You can export all your work back to your computer to facilitate the synthesis and write up of your coded data.
- Click on the **Highlights** tab, and then the **See all highlights** button.
- Look to the right of the screen and click on the **Export this view** button, and then select the export format to **EXCEL**.

5. **Open up the Excel file** that you downloaded from Taguette. (This file is usually located in your computer’s Downloads folder.)

6. In the Excel file, locate the **“tag” column.**
  - Click on the first cell under the header “tag” (for example, cell C1).
  - Select all the cells in that column that contain tag names.
  - Then copy the cells, go to **Edit > Copy** (or use **Ctrl + C** (Windows) / **Cmd + C** (Mac)) to copy the selected tags.

7. If you haven’t done so already, create a free account on the [Word Art Website](https://wordart.com/){:target="_blank"} in a new tab. (You only need to do this once. If you already have an account, you can skip this step.)

8. After logginf into  Word Art, click on **Dashboard.**

9. On the Dashboard page, click the **Create**.

10. In the editor screen, click the **Import** button.

11. In the Import dialog box, 
  - **Paste the data you copied from Excel** (the list of tags) into the text field using **Ctrl + V** (Windows) or **Cmd + V** (Mac).
  - Make sure to paste only the words, **do not include the column headers (‘tag)’.**
  - Then check the **“CSV format”** checkbox and confirm the import.

12. Click on **Import Words** to load the data you pasted.

13. The word art may generate automatically. (If it does not appear right away, click the red **Generate** button to create the word cloud using your imported words.)

14. To make sure each word only appears once: 
  - Go to the **Words** tab.
  - Click the **Columns** button (near the top of the word list).
  - Make sure the **Repeat** column is checked so it becomes visible.
  - In the word list, review the Repeat column and uncheck the box next to each word.
  - This ensures that every word appears only once in your design.

15. Click **Generate** again to refresh the word art with the updated settings.

16. To customize the appearance, use the left sidebar:
  - Click on **Fonts** and select the font style you prefer.

17. Click **Generate** once more to apply your changes. (Tip: If you don’t like the layout or arrangement, simply click Generate again to try a different variation.) 

**Using Pivot tables to Visualize all coded text (not just tag/code names)** This will create a Word Cloud from Full Coded Content

18. Return to Excel file and select the **Content** column (usually cell D1). 

19. Select any cell inside the table, then go to the **Insert** tab in Excel and choose **Pivot Table**.<br>

20. In the **Create PivotTable** dialog box, keep the default settings and click **OK** to create a new pivot table.

21. In the PivotTable Fields panel on the right:
  - Check the box next to **Content** to add it to the pivot table.
  - Then drag **Content** into the **Rows** area so that all coded passages appear in the table.

22. Click inside the list of content displayed in the pivot table, then select all of the text. Copy the selected text using **Edit > Copy** (or **Ctrl + C** (Windows) / **Cmd + C** (Mac)).

23. Open the **Word Art website** in a new tab and create a new word art project. Follow **Steps 7–14** from the previous section to start a new design and import text.

24. **Customize the Word Art Design.** To change shape of your word cloud:  
  - In the left sidebar, click on **Shapes**.
  - Select the shape you would like to use.
  - Click the **Generate** button to apply the new shape and refresh the design.

  - From the dropdown menu, choose Standard PNG as the file format.
  - Save the file with a clear name (for example: Taguette_WordArt_YourName.png) to your computer.

You should now have some visualizations that will hopefully be useful to include with the qualitative data that you have created in Taguette.  Great job!
