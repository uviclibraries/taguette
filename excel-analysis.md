# Intermediate Analysis with Excel

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

In addition, if you think you would find it helpful, here is a [step-by-step video tutorial for this activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvqVeZPoEvs){:target="_blank"} as a suplement to the steps below.

1. **Log in to Taguette** and open your project so you can see your documents. Then select the **Highlights** tab.
2. Next click on the **See all highlight**s button to view summaries of all of the passages that you coded.

3. **Exporting your Passages in Preparation for Writing Up Your Research**: You can export all of your coded passages to your computer to help with synthesis and writing.
  - In **Highlights** tab, click **See all highlights**.
  - In the top right corner of the screen, click the “**Export this view**” dropdown menu.
  - Select **Excel** format to download your coded passages as a spreadsheet.

4. **Pivot Table to Count Tags**: This will give you a high level summary of the number of times you use codes or tags across all the documents in your research project. 
  - **Open up the Excel file** you just downloaded to your computer.

5. In the Excel file, select the **document, tag, and content** columns, including all rows of data.

7. In the **PivotTable Fields** panel on the right-hand side:
  - Check the box next to **tag**.
  - Then drag **tag** into the **Values** area below.
  - This will generate a count of how many times each tag was used.

8. **Pivot Table to Count Tags in Each Document.** This step will create a summary showing how many times each code or tag appears within each individual document.
  - Return to the original worksheet (usually called “highlights”) at the bottom of the Excel file.

9. Again, select the **document**, **tag**, and **content** columns, including all data.

11. In the PivotTable Fields panel on the right-hand side, check both the **document** and **tag** checkboxes.
![Select documents & tag](/images/taguette-excel-7.png)

12. Drag the **document** to the **Rows** area. (This will shows how many tags appear in each document).

13. In the **Rows area**, drag the **tag** field so that it appears below the **document** field. (This will display a detailed breakdown of tag counts within each document.)

You should now have some summary quantitative data that will hopefully be useful to include with the qualitative data that you created in Taguette. Great job!
