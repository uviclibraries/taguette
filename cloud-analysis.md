# Visualization with Word Clouds

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

In addition, if you think you would find it helpful, here is a [step-by-step video tutorial for this activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4P-VNo7ozU){:target="_blank"} as a suplement to the steps below.

1. Create a free account at the [**Word Art**](https://wordart.com/){:target="_blank"} website. 

   **Note:** If you have just completed “**Activity 4 – Excel Activities**” in this workshop, you can skip Steps 2-4 and proceed directly to Step 5.

2. **Log in to Taguette** and open your project so you can see your uploaded documents.

3. Select the **Highlights** tab, then click “**See all highlights**” to view a summary of all the passages you have coded.

4. **Exporting your Passages in Preparation for Writing Up Your Research**: Exporting all your Passages with their Codes - You can export all your work back to your computer to facilitate the synthesis and write up of your coded data.
- Click on the **Highlights** tab, and then the **See all highlights** button.
- Look to the right of the screen and click on the **Export this view** button, and then select the export format to **EXCEL**.

5. **Open up the Excel file** that you downloaded from Taguette. (This file is usually located in your computer’s Downloads folder.)

6. In the Excel file, locate the **“tag” column.**
  - Click on the first cell under the header “tag” (for example, cell C1).
  - Select all the cells in that column that contain tag names.
  - Then copy the cells, go to **Edit > Copy** (or use **Ctrl + C** (Windows) / **Cmd + C** (Mac)) to copy the selected tags.

7. If you haven’t done so already, create a free account on the [Word Art Website](https://wordart.com/){:target="_blank"} in a new tab. (You only need to do this once. If you already have an account, you can skip this step.)

8. After logginf into  Word Art, click on **Dashboard.**

9. On the Dashboard page, click the **Create**.

10. In the editor screen, click the **Import** button.

11. In the Import dialog box, 
  - **Paste the data you copied from Excel** (the list of tags) into the text field using **Ctrl + V** (Windows) or **Cmd + V** (Mac).
  - Make sure to paste only the words, **do not include the column headers (‘tag)’.**
  - Then check the **“CSV format”** checkbox and confirm the import.

12. Click on **Import Words** to load the data you pasted.

13. The word art may generate automatically. (If it does not appear right away, click the red **Generate** button to create the word cloud using your imported words.)

14. To make sure each word only appears once: 
  - Go to the **Words** tab.
  - Click the **Columns** button (near the top of the word list).
  - Make sure the **Repeat** column is checked so it becomes visible.
  - In the word list, review the Repeat column and uncheck the box next to each word.
  - This ensures that every word appears only once in your design.

15. Click **Generate** again to refresh the word art with the updated settings.

16. To customize the appearance, use the left sidebar:
  - Click on **Fonts** and select the font style you prefer.

17. Click **Generate** once more to apply your changes. (Tip: If you don’t like the layout or arrangement, simply click Generate again to try a different variation.) 

**Pivot tables to Visualize all coded text (not just code names):

18. Next, return to Excel sheet and select the **content** column

19. Select the **insert** button and select **pivot table** and with the default settings select **ok**.<br>

20. Under the pivot table fields on the right, click the **content checkbox**

21. Drag the **content checkbox** to **rows**

22. Select the **content** and on the computer bar, select **edit** and **copy** in the dropdown

23. Next, create a new word art (redo steps 7-14 from the previous section)

24. **Adding Shapes**:  Select **shapes** in the left side, click on the shape of your choice and then select visualize

26. Save as “name your file” and **save**

You should now have some visualizations that will hopefully be useful to include with the qualitative data that you have created in Taguette.  Great job!
